 Ever wondered how Netflix or any other media platform (even YouTube) can recommend content that is to your liking? Well, it turns out, that these apps use recommendation systems to curate content specific to one user.

Then in the terminal of jupyter notebook go to the folder where app.py is present install Streamlit and run the command streamlit run app.py this will run your python file on the browser automatically.
